 * Note: there is no `ngSwitch` here since it's typically used as a regular
 * binding (e.g. `[ngSwitch]`), however the `ngSwitchCase` and `ngSwitchDefault`
 * are used as structural directives and a warning would be generated. Once the
 * `CommonModule` is included, the `ngSwitch` would also be covered.
